### React Portfolio

## Purpose
I will be creating a React portfolio, so I can work with popular tools and languages. This portfolio will be used to demonstrate my skills with these tools and languages, but also be an opportunity to show the reader a little bit about me and my capabilities.

## Portfolio Guidlines
# Sections
- Hero Page w/ button to download resume
- About Me
- Projects
- Experience
- Contact Form 

# Constraints
- Should be neat and minimalistic
- smooth scrolling and animations
- Contains dark mode toggle
- Projects section should automatically grab 3-4 projects from my github page (github.com/gillemta) and

# Note
I have a figma mockup of the mobile and desktop versions of my portfolio, I can provide the colors and fonts used so we can set up the infrastucture

## Tools

## Learning Focus Areas
- **React Hooks**: useState, useEffect, useContext, useRef
- **TypeScript**: Interfaces, types, generics
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility classes, responsive design, custom configurations
- **Framer Motion**: Animations, transitions, gesture handling
- **GitHub API**: Fetching data, error handling, data transformation
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach, breakpoints, flexible layouts

## Best Practices to Follow
- **Component Structure**: Keep components small and focused
- **Type Safety**: Use TypeScript interfaces for all props and data
- **Performance**: Use React.memo, useMemo, useCallback when appropriate
- **Accessibility**: Add proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation
- **Code Organization**: Separate concerns, use custom hooks for logic
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error boundaries and user feedback

## Current Status
- âœ… React + Vite + TypeScript setup
- âœ… Basic project structure
- âœ… Deployed to Vercel
- ðŸ”„ Ready to start Phase 1: Project Setup & Infrastructure

## Next Steps
1. Install Tailwind CSS and configure with your Figma colors/fonts
2. Set up Framer Motion for animations
3. Create the basic project folder structure
4. Begin implementing the layout and navigation

# Cursor Instructions
Based on everything I have wrote in this markdown file I want you to help me lay out a step by step outline of this project such as the steps I need to take, best practices, etc. This project is supposed to be a learning opportunity, so rather than me depending on you to code for me, I plan to follow a Plan -> Code -> Explain process. This process will consist of me giving you my game plan for each step that, I code it out then you explain to me what I could do better and the tradeoffs of that etc. Do not modify any of my src files or commits unless I tell you to. Before you modify this file with what all I have told you to do, please ask clarifying questions to understand you are understanding me correctly. I ca
